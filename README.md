Submitted by: **Fayrouz Mikhael**

Time spent: **120** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* Remembering the bill amount across app restarts
* Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes (Describe any challenges encountered while building the app)
1- I Tried to do auto layout using Constraints but the problem was I couldnâ€™t find how to connect the keyboard with the uiview

2- I Tried to do the default tip but the tip goes from the main controller view and put it in the default text which is the opposite for what it should be. 
I comment all what I did in that part.

3- Also the animation for the settings: I did it and it does work but the problem was when I press it , it does not open the setting page. Also I wrote the code and I commented it.
